<h1>Ian's Hacker Rank Solutions</h1>
<p>This repo contains various solutions to the technical challenges presented on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>. Most (all) are written in Ruby 1.9. Below is a description of each of the files.

<h4>Alternate.rb</h4>is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/alternating-characters">Alternating Characters</a>". It takes a string of characters, for example "AAABBBAABBAA" and measures the number of characters to be deleted such that the string alternates between A and B, with no repeated characters.<br />
<h4>Bitwise.rb</h4>is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximizing-xor">Maximizing XOR</a>". It takes two integers and finds the maximum XOR value between them.<br />
<h4>Change.rb</h4>is a solution to a nearly ubiquous code challenge found all over the web. It takes a given quantity of change and returns the optimal quantity of each coin to form the specified quantity.<br />
<h4>Chocolate.rb</h4>is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/chocolate-feast">Chocolate Feast</a>". It's problem statement is as follows: _Little Bob loves chocolates, and goes to a store with $N in his pocket. The price of each chocolate is $C. The store offers a discount: for every M wrappers he gives to the store, he gets one chocolate for free. How many chocolates does Bob get to eat?_
<h4>Hallow.rb</h4> is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/halloween-party">Halloween Party</a>". It finds the maximum number of 1x1 chocolate squares that can be created by cutting a chocolate bar N times.<br />
<h4>Newp.rb</h4> is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-love-letter-mystery">The Love-Letter Mystery</a>". It finds the minimum number of operations required to convert a string of characters into a palindrome if the characters can only be incremented upwards towards the letter "a". **Palindrome.rb** is a failed solution to this problem that I like to keep around. : )<br />
<h4>Thrones.rb</h4> is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones - I</a>". It determines whether or not a given string of characters is an anagram of a palindrome.<br />
<h4>Utopiantree.rb</h4> is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/utopian-tree">Utopian Tree</a>". It determines the height a tree has grown after a certain number of alternating growth cycles.<br />
<h4>Manasa.rb</h4> is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/manasa-and-stones">Manasa and Stones</a> It finds the terminating stone (the sum) of alternating combinations of stones.<br />
