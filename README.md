<h1>Ian's Hacker Rank Solutions</h1>
<p>This repo contains various solutions to the technical challenges presented on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>. Most (all) are written in Ruby 1.9. Below is a description of each of the files.

<h4>Alternate.rb</h4>is a solution to the challenge titled "<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/alternating-characters">Alternating Characters</a>".
